<h2>About</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An homage to Nursing Day, this website presents some proposals for students/professionals in the field as well as for people who may eventually receive their care. It is an educational and informational website about the profession and how we can and should conduct ourselves in relation to it.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In honor of Nursing Day, the DIV/DEV/1M class from Proz Educa√ß√£o created a website to recognize and value the profession. For a long time in Brazil, nursing was seen as a poorly valued area and an alternative to medicine, but fortunately in recent years it has been receiving its deserved recognition, and we decided to make this small tribute to these great professionals.</p>

<br>

<h2>Creation Process</h2>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on students' reports regarding the profession, functional and non-functional requirements were identified for the creation of a website aimed at valuing Nursing. Non-functional points such as support sections for professionals and patients, as well as a news blog, were considered. Addressing topics such as mental health and collaboration in the workplace are examples of non-functional requirements addressed in this project.</p>

<h3>Development and Testing:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, the frontend part of the site was created from a completely restyled template with the theme's content. Keeping part of the website and adapting it to the requirements' needs, the frontend was developed. On the other hand, the backend, structured from the beginning, includes a database capable of storing form submissions by users and recording this contact for possible future reports.</p>

<h3>Hosting:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site was hosted on a free hosting service, 000Webhost, which limits its functionalities, making actions such as sending newsletters to users unfeasible. However, the site is active and fully functional.</p>
